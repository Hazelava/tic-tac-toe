 Did you know i write frictional stories as side hustle in manga app and in wattpad😉,
 I write and read frictional books just to escape the reality and have a quality time with myself,
 you can't except me to be social when i have holidays😎😎...

I have a tiny quotes page where i write some quotes
"When my emotions decide to throw a surprise party—sometimes joyful,
 sometimes dramatic—I turn them into quotes.
 It’s my way of capturing feelings, both epic and chaotic,
 so future me can look back and say, ‘Ah yes, the drama!’" 😆✍️

   "Code like it's magic, debug like it's a mystery novel." 🧙‍♂️🔍
